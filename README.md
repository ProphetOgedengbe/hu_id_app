## IDApp Code Breakdown

### **Core Purpose**
A dual-image display app that mimics an ID presentation system - shows one image normally, reveals a second "ID" image when needed.

### **Main Components**

**State Management:**
- `isSetupComplete` - toggles between setup screen and main app
- `images` - stores URIs for main and ID images 
- `tapCount/tapTimeout` - tracks triple-tap gestures
- `idAnim` - controls slide-down animation for ID screen

**Key Functions:**

1. **Image Management**
   - `pickImage()` - selects from photo library
   - `takePhoto()` - captures with camera
   - `showImageOptions()` - displays camera/library choice alert
   - `getImageSource()` - returns uploaded image or default asset

2. **Navigation Controls**
   - `handleTripleTap()` - triple-tap top-left returns to setup
   - `showIDScreen()` - tap top-right slides down ID image
   - `handleDoubleTap()` - double-tap ID screen instantly returns to main

3. **UI Rendering**
   - `renderSetupScreen()` - configuration interface with image previews
   - Main screen - fullscreen main image with invisible tap zones
   - Animated overlay - ID screen slides down from top

### **User Interface Flow**

**Setup Screen:**
- Welcome text and instructions
- Two image upload areas with overlay buttons
- Preview of current images (defaults to bundled assets)
- OK button to enter main app

**Main Screen:**
- Fullscreen main image
- Invisible tap zones: top-left (triple-tap setup), top-right (show ID)
- Animated ID overlay that slides down when triggered

### **Technical Implementation**

**Dependencies:**
- React Native core components
- `expo-image-picker` for camera/gallery access
- Animated API for smooth transitions

**Assets Required:**
- `assets/main_image.jpg` - default main screen image
- `assets/id_image.jpg` - default ID screen image

**Permissions:**
- Camera access for photo capture
- Photo library access for image selection

### **Interaction Pattern**
The app creates a discrete ID presentation system where the primary interface appears as a simple image display, but hidden gestures reveal the secondary ID functionality. The animation system provides smooth transitions while double-tap allows quick concealment of the ID screen.
